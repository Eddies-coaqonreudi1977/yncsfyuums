Oh man, Last Breath was... something else. Literally just walked out the theater and my back is killing me. These chairs are torture devices. But wow, this  ... it's like, if you took a hurricane and stuffed it inside a blender with a bunch of emotions and then just let it rip.

There was this scene, God, when he was underwater and it felt like I was drowning with him. The sound of my popcorn crunching was like, the only tether to reality, you know? And I swear, I nearly dropped my drink during that bit where the whole screen just goes white. A guy behind me sneezed, and suddenly I was back, but like, still kind of there.

> You know when you're trying to keep bubblegum from sticking to your shoe, and you're doing this awkward dance? That's like how the plot felt at times. Not in a bad way though. It's just... 𝘧𝘳𝘦𝘦. Yeah. 𝘧𝘳𝘦𝘦.

And the actress, she was incredible. The part where she screams, not like in fear but more like you're screaming at a pizza delivery guy who's four hours late, but you're too nice to really be angry? That was art. My mind's still in knots. I bet the director just said, go for it, because wow. Just... wow.

Someone asked if they should 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   or 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   in theaters – honestly, the sound of the 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮 felt like it was bouncing right off my skull. Best to see it with all the chaos around you. Makes sense, somehow. Don't ask why.

And ugh, popcorn crumbs everywhere. It’s like attacking me every time I move. My leg is asleep too. Great. But hey, it kind of fits, being half awake after that emotional whirlwind.

Not sure I entirely got it—the ending was so dreamlike, like an empty bus swaying on a foggy night—but that's what rewind buttons are for, right? Def gonna give it another go when my head clears.

    return ??? # no idea really, my brain's fried
